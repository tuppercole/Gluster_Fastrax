=== Transcript

Gluster is a leading software-defined storage system that is popular for building large, distributed storage solutions for media streaming, data analysis, and other data- and bandwidth-intensive tasks. This module discusses six key design principles for architecting a Gluster server cluster to best fit your customerâ€™s needs. Reference architecture examples then show how various configurations perform in terms of throughput and cost. A final table summarizes a number of optimized configurations based on specific criteria.

As such, this module covers the following topics:

* Six design principles for architecting Gluster clusters
* Performance considerations with Gluster
* Sample optimized hardware configurations
* Subsystem sizing guidelines
