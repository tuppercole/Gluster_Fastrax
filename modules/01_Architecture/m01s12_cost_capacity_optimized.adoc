== Optimized for Cost and Capacity

* CapEx: Lowest $/TB 
* OpEx: Lowest BTU/TB 
* OpEx: Lowest watt/TB 
* OpEx: Highest TB/Rack-unit 
* Minimum server-fault domain _recommendation_ (1 server is <15% cluster)

=== Transcript

Using the term "cost/capacity-optimized" means the cluster is designed to achieve the lowest overall cost per terabyte of usable capacity, as well as the lowest power and cooling costs per usable terabyte.

Some data center costs are calculated by floor space, so also look for configurations that offer highest usable terabytes per rack-unit. As cost-capacity clusters typically have more relaxed performance requirements, minimum server fault-domain recommendations for ability to retain quorum with a single server failure.
