== Data Protection Schemes

* Replication 
** Gluster file storage default: 2x replication over RAID6 bricks.

* Erasure Coding
** Erasure coding provides failure protection beyond just single/double component failure and consumes less space than replication.

=== Transcript

Gluster storage can support any size replication scheme and can be stretched across LAN or WAN topologies with Gluster geo-replication. Depending upon the performance needs and read/write mix of an object storage workload, an erasure-coded volume can provide an extremely cost-effective solution while meeting performance requirements.
