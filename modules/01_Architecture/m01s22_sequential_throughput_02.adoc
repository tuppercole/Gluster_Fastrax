=== Transcript

On this slide you see the throughput achieved per each OSD, in contrast to the previous slide's throughput per server. As the cost of OSD media -- either HDD or SSD -- is typically the most expensive part of the configuration, the customer can save money by getting each OSD to do more work.  

Note that the lines on this graph are almost in reverse order from the previous graph. While the 12+1 server configuration offers the least amount of throughput per server, it offers the most amount of throughput per OSD. While the 72+0 server configuration offers nearly the most throughput per server, it achieves the lowest throughput per OSD. As a result, many customers deploying strictly throughput-optimized clusters have chosen to deploy 12-bay and 16-bay server chassis, instead of more dense servers.  

There is, however, a major caveat: subsequent benchmark studies have shown a much tighter grouping of OSD throughput results for similar configurations, as continued development has increased OSD throughput in denser servers.
