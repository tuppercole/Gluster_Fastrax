=== Transcript

This and the following two slides present a price/performance analysis. This first slide compares relative price/performance of five different configurations. The list price of each configured cluster of the same capacity was divided by the clusterâ€™s sequential read throughput performance. As shown, the 12x4T OSD plus one PCIe write journal configuration offered the best read price per performance in this study.
