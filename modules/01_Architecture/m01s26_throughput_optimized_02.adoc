=== Transcript

This chart shows write price/performance versus read price/performance on the previous slide. Here, the configuration with 12x4T OSDs with one PCIe write journal and the configuration with 36x4T OSDs with two PCIe write journals offered similar price/performance. This study also illustrates the positive effect that dedicated flash write journals have on sequential write price/performance.
