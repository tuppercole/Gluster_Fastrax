=== Transcript

Gluster is a powerful software-defined storage system that is very popular for building flexible and resilient scale-out storage. This module discussed the key elements of designing a Gluster server cluster to best fit your customer's needs. Reference architecture examples showed how various configurations perform in terms of throughput and cost, and a final table summarizes a number of optimized configurations based on specific criteria. 

This module covered the following topics:

* Six design principles for architecting Gluster clusters
* Sample optimized hardware configurations
* Subsystem sizing guidelines
